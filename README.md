Application Description
Movie Information App
This application is designed to help users search for movies and find information about them. The app includes the following features:

*A search function that allows users to look for movies. After the search, users can use a "Clean Search" button to clear the results.
*A functionality to search for movie screenings by specific cinemas. Users can find details about which cinemas are playing specific movies and the showtimes.
*The app's color scheme is primarily gray, black, and yellow, inspired by the branding of Finnkino, creating a modern and cohesive user experience.

Strengths:
My project meets all the required functionality and features as outlined in the assignment.
I successfully implemented a working search function and integrated a user-friendly clean search button.
The app aligns with the specified Finnkino color theme, providing a consistent visual identity.
Areas for Improvement:
Due to time constraints, I focused only on delivering the required features without adding advanced functionalities or significant visual design enhancements.
Future improvements could include additional features, such as user profiles or enhanced animations, and a more polished visual design.
